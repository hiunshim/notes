	- For Anki, what end up happening is people start memorizing the card itself. Not the actual content, but the shape, word count, keywords, etc. and immediately recognize what the answer of the card should be. LLM should be able to modify this so that the "concept" itself is learned, not the card. It should ask me questions and make even more cards broken down into smaller concepts if I get it wrong.
