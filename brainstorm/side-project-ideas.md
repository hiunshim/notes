	- Like git submodules. Notion is hard because it's a separate system. I want to take notes or blog, but I want it combined with my friend. If I "tag" a note or a directory, I want to see a combined summary (or new info since a certain date) of the two tags between my and my friend's notes once I push to git (but why on push, maybe on rebase? or better summary of what happened to the codebase so far on rebase?)
	- For Anki, what end up happening is people start memorizing the card itself. Not the actual content, but the shape, word count, keywords, etc. and immediately recognize what the answer of the card should be. LLM should be able to modify this so that the "concept" itself is learned, not the card. It should ask me questions and make even more cards broken down into smaller concepts if I get it wrong.
		- chatgpt project like interface per concept "session" of learning.
		- excel as DB, row as card, tab as project
