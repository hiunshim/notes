acts as an intermediary that sends client requests to the internet and forwards responses back to the client.
- hides client IPs from the server
- access control: restricts which websites or services clients can access
- caching: reduce bandwidth usage by caching responses
- anonymity: using proxy servers to hide IP

works at the application layer (layer 7) or the network layer (layer 3/4) depending on the implementation [[osi-model]].
