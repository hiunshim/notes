fast, persistent, key-value store

1. high read/write performance
2. persists data to disk unlike in-memory storage like Redis
3. optimized for small key-value pairs
4. embedded within the application and operates locally on the server. this reduces network latency compared to remote stores like DynamoDB or Redis
5. optimized for low resource usage that need high-performance and low-latency
